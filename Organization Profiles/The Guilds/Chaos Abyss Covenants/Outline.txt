Temporary notes, will elaborate.

Leadership: [REDACTED INFOHAZARD] - All members act as representatives separately.
General membership: Mamono originating from the Abyss.
Influence: Technically this Guild acts as an exchange program of sorts, spreading Abyss madness while learning about the insanity we consider normal life.  Secondarily act as mental-health consultants in conjunction with Mamono Medical Masters Guild.
Range: Difficult to properly describe due to individual members establishing territory at-will.  Guild Embassies are a guarantee at least.
