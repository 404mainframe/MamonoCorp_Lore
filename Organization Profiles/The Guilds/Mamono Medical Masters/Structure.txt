Leadership - Legacy
The ultimate leadership of this Guild can be found in the unicorn Diana and her husband, though their lack of interest in politics means they tend to lead entirely by example.  The amount of influence they've had in the Guild's formation and the degree of respect they've earned mean that if they were to ever take any stance of authority, their word would be indisputed law.

Leadership - Active
Actual day-to-day management of this Guild is handled by a small council of ancient Unicorns and their spouses, more due to age than anything else.  Their years of experience mean that they have experience in handling all sorts of affairs, and as such can more readily deal with the absurdities of bureaucracy than any of the younger, more energetic Guildmates.  Additionally, their position lends gravitas, and any situation where they are called to act directly garners immediate attention.

Advocacy
This level of the organization has the lower-rank students cycle through on a regular basis, allowing interaction with others while still finishing up their training.  Additionally, the intense energy of the younger, more idealistic members adds a degree of presentation that even experience cannot quite match up to.

Active Members
This level is all other members combined.  Humans and Mamono of all kinds can be found among these ranks, working in groups according to skill and specialty.
