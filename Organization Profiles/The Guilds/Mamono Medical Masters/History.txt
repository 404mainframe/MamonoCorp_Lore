Long ago, a Unicorn healer and a medical mage met, fell in love, and married.  Their views on life and love coincided with their desires to see good health available for all, and so they began traveling, teaching and healing as they went.  Over time, this pair gained a following of humans and Mamono alike.  The steadily-growing band developed a reputation out of their actions, and soon people were referring to them by variants on a theme of "those medical Mamono" and similar.  

With reputation came requests for aid, particularly from nations desiring the group's services on a more permanent basis.  Some of the followers determined to accept such offers, becoming fixtures in growing towns and cities, but the original pair felt that more could be done, more needed to be done.  As such, they began laying groundwork for more formal systems of education and aid practices.  They did not simply provide healing and teaching as they traveled, but instead worked to ensure that the people they met would be able to take better care of themselves even after moving on.

Yet more time passed, and the core group occasionally found themselves in places they had visited previously.  For the most part these population centers had benefited and stayed well, but in far too many cases, financial corruption, ignorance, and sheer laziness had caused harm to patients.  And so the group determined to create a more effective, wide-reaching system, able to define and educate good medical practice while also seeing that no such decline would occur again.  In modern times, this has become the work of the "Mamono Medical Masters" Guild, so named because none of its members could think of something appropriate, save for a Sidhe making a joke that spread too far to contain.
