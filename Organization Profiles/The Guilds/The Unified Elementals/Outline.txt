Temporary notes, will elaborate.

Leadership: Jointly held between the groups, though Ice Queens often handle bureaucracy.
General membership: All known elementals.  Minor overlap with Eastern contingent due to Yuki-Onna groupings.
Influence: Various activities, including survivalist training and some magical assistance.  Old treaty with Wizard Corps.
Range: All nations, due to ancient outreach and treaties.  Minimal interest in politics limits possibility of power-shift.
