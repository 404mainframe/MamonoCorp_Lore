Scattered throughout the world in various temples and abbeys, the Order of the White Lotus is a monastic order committed to knowledge, pursuit of enlightenment, and the practice of living in harmony with the natural ebb and flow of the universe.

The monks of the White Lotus are a wide and diverse group, drawing freely from any background without regard for past, national origin, race, economic status, religious affiliation, or even species.

Monks of the White Lotus can be found outside their temples and abbeys in many instances, as the order's formal training progression includes a path by which monks can seek a state of enlightenment in life as a citizen of the world, retreating to a temple or abbey for brief periods of sequestration, meditation, and intensive training. Despite the differences between these monks and their more conventional brethren, almost all monks of the White Lotus are believed to be capable of some form of supernatural ability involving the channeling of Ki, a form of spiritual energy found to ebb and flow throughout all things.

Though the Order of the White Lotus rarely makes active, concerted recruitment efforts, their understated but constant presence in local communities ensures that the halls of the various abbeys and temples are rarely wanting for occupants, as the steady influence of the local chapter is readily felt by anyone who seeks it.
