MerMobility Chair
The MerMobility wheelchair allows Mermaid-pattern Mamono ease of land-transit in most modern environments.  Featuring a sealable "seat," the chair acts to limit the effects of dehydration on its operator, extending the range of safe and comfortable travel.

SlimeSkin Envirosuit
Similar to the MerMobility chair, the SlimeSkin pressurized environment suit is a mobility and activity enhancement system.  Intended for Slimes and other fluid Mamono, the SlimeSkin provides a sturdy, reliable "body" to interact with the world, while at the same time ensuring that no loss of sensation is experienced.

My Cuddle Boyfriend
The My Cuddle Boyfriend line of humanoid animatronics is at its core meant to temporarily ease the pangs of need arising from a lack of a man in a Mamono's life.  Models created at licensed facilities are sturdy enough to handle the energetic affections of even a Lunacy-roused Ushi-Oni, yet soft and "kind" to the touch.  While most Mamono have agreed the MCB does not quite measure up to the feeling of a man, the consensus is that they feel close enough to allow a measure of comfort in times of lonesome need.  Two general models exist: the all-ages variety meant for Mamono only in need of a cuddle, and the specialty variant intended only for adults.

SynthSleeve bodies and mods
AI and Automaton Mamono interact with the world through artificial bodies, and the SynthSleeve system allows for control of how those bodies function.  With a wide range of features to choose from and immense customization options for appearance, SynthSleeves can be made to match any lifestyle.  Mamono such as Cursed Weapons can use SynthSleeves as well, possessing the bodies as hosts for both transportation and interaction with their chosen Human without interference from others.

Vehicle mods - street
Regardless of how carefully they're driven, there's no denying that modern transporation is simply not safe by default for any non-humanoid Mamono.  Vehicle mods such as floor-mounted safety restraints for Lamia-pattern Mamono or digitigrade-compatible pedals for those with hooves or paws work to ensure a safer, more relaxing driving experience.

Vehicle mods - other
For the smaller Mamono, quadcopter and similar drones can be outfitted with control systems, allowing both flight and relatively-rapid transport.  Multiple packages exist, ranging from a simple chair with basic control sticks to an advanced racing-style cockpit, primarily limited by the size and power capacity of the drone.

DreamLink
A new device, the DreamLink system allows two people to share dreams, much the same way Nightmares and Mindflayers enter others' minds.  The device effectively gives two individuals a chance to get to know one another more completely, and for obvious reasons is especially useful for lovers.  
An additional feature can be found in the MindSplit function; effectively the opposite of the DreamLink, the MindSplit allows the user to temporarily push a portion of their consciousness into a SynthSleeve robot.  Multiple uses for this tool exist, and while it is recommended that care be taken at all times, experimentation is strongly recommended for best results.
